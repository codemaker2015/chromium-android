1. [Checking out and building Chromium for Android](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md), to match our build settings, use [tools/args.gn](tools/args.gn)
2. Generate files for Android Studio with offical guide: [Android Studio](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_studio.md)

	- After that, you can find some ```build.gradle``` files in ```[BUILD_TARGET]/gradle```, which defines the Java sources for Chromium.

3. Try sync files with script: [tools/sync_chromium.sh](tools/sync_chromium.sh)

	- Replace `BASE_DIR` in script with your Chromium src dir.
	- Replace `RELEASE_DIR` in script with your build dir.
	- `PRO_DIR` is the dir where new files will copied to.

4. Finally, replace all files in this project with the new files.
